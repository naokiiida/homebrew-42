# Homebrew Tap for 42

Welcome to the `naokiiida/42` Homebrew tap! This tap contains formulas for various tools related to the 42 programming school.

## Installation

To use this tap, you need to have Homebrew installed on your system. If you haven't installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) yet, you can do so by running:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Note, I haven't tested this on the 42 school computers.

Once Homebrew is installed, you can tap this repository by running:

```bash
brew tap naokiiida/42
```

## Available Formulae

After tapping the repository, you can install the available formulae. For example, to install `norminette` and `c_formatter_42`, you would run:

```bash
brew install norminette c_formatter_42
```

## Updating the Tap

To update your tap and get the latest versions of the formulas, you can run:

```bash
brew update
```

## Uninstalling a Formula

If you need to uninstall a formula, you can do so with:

```bash
brew uninstall c_formatter_42
```
